# This program allows a user to play a version of the popular game, Wordle.
#
# Once a txt file is imported (optional file is included), the program filters
# the words so that only words that are 5 letters, have no repeated letters, and
# are in the wordlist can be inputed. 
# Much like the real game, there are 6 tries given, and each round, the program will
# tell the user which letters are in the right place, not in the right place, or not
# in the word. 
# 
# To start the game, download the python file, and the provided wordlist if needed in
# the same folder. Entering the file name in the beginning, "wordlist.txt" should 
# activate the game. If the file cannot be found by the program, then it will end the game.
# Thank you!
